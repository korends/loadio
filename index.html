    <h1>Elephants: they're the sh*t!</h1>
    <p>Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth, and they're one of the most unique-looking animals, too. With
        their characteristic long noses, or trunks; large, floppy ears; and wide, thick legs, there is no other animal
        with a similar physique.</p>

    <p>They are well-known for living in matriarchal (female-led) social groups, and although elephants are respected
        and revered by people throughout their ranges in Africa and South Asia, they are also feared because they can be
        aggressive and dangerous.</p>
